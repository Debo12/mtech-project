<====================== High Level Steps ======================>
1. Data Understanding and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Econometric Methods
4. Feature/Variable Selection
5. Model Selection and Training
6. Model Evaluation
7. Model Interpretation
8. Econometric Diagnostics and Validation

<====================== 3. Econometric Methods ======================>
1. Econometrics vs Machine Learning:- Econometrics helps to understand why things happen and ML helps to make accurate guess about the future.

<====================== 4. How to do Feature Selection ======================>
1. Filter Methods: Use statistical measures to select features (e.g., correlation coefficients, chi-square test).
2. Wrapper Methods: Use a predictive model to evaluate combinations of features and select the best performing set (e.g., recursive feature elimination).
3. Embedded Methods: Perform feature selection during the model training process (e.g., Lasso regularization).
